# :musical_keyboard: ChordCraft - Backend Code 
ChordCraft is an Android Application built to help users identify chordal features in any audio provided. This project is divided into two main repositories:

- **Frontend Application** ([Link](https://github.com/RaifCos/FYP202526-Costello-ChordCraft-Frontend))
- **Backend API** (Current Repo)

## 	:guitar: Backend API
This repository contains the API used by the frontend application. When called, the API runs one of three different Automatic Chord Extraction Models, returning the results as a formatted JSON for the frontend to display to the user:
- Hardcoded Chromatic Feature Analysis 
- Librosa Python Library Chromatic Feature Analysis
- chord-CNN-LSTM AI Model 

## :round_pushpin: About this Application
The ChordCraft is being developed as part of University of Galway CT413 Final Year Project module FY25/26 with the project title "ChordCraft - Audio-to-Guitar Chords".
